üöß _We are building in public. This is presently under heavy construction._

## ‚ú® Features

- 100% free and unencumbered public domain software.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) 1.81+

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

### Installation from Source Code

#### Installation via Cargo

```bash
cargo install asimov-dataset-cli@25.0.0-dev.5
```

### Installation using Package Manager

#### [Scoop](https://scoop.sh)

First things first, you need to add our custom scoop bucket.
This needs to be done only once, so that scoop knows where to find our packages.

```bash
scoop bucket add asimov-platform https://github.com/asimov-platform/scoop-bucket
```

Now, installing ASIMOV CLI is as easy as running:

```bash
scoop install asimov-platform/asimov-dataset-cli
```

## Setup

### NEAR Account

If you don't have a NEAR account yet, you can create one using NEAR CLI:

```bash
near account create-account
```

Follow the prompts to complete the account creation process.

## Signing transactions

To publish datasets to the ASIMOV network, you need to sign transactions with your NEAR account. The CLI supports two methods:

### 1. Use system keychain

If your system keychain already contains your credentials you don't need to do anything further. You will be prompted to allow access to the the signer account's private key when publishing.

Otherwise if you have a NEAR account which is not in your system keychain, you can import it to your system keychain:

```bash
near account import-account
```

Then follow the prompts and select `Store the access key in my keychain` when asked.

### 2. Use Environment Variable

If you prefer not to store your credentials in the system keychain or you're having trouble authenticating with the keychain, you can provide your private key via an environment variable:

```bash
# Get your private key if you don't have it yet
near account export-account

# Set the environment variable with your private key
export NEAR_PRIVATE_KEY="ed25519:..."

# Run the command (no additional authentication needed)
asimov-dataset publish your-repo.testnet ./data.ttl
```

You can also specify a different signing account using the `--signer` option or `NEAR_SIGNER` environment variable:

```bash
asimov-dataset publish --signer other-account.testnet your-repo.testnet ./data.ttl
```

## üëâ Examples

```bash
# publish RDF data in data1.ttl and data2.nt to an on-chain repository at your-repo.testnet
asimov-dataset publish --network testnet your-repo.testnet ./data1.ttl ./data2.nt
```

## üìö Reference

TBD

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asimov-platform/asimov-dataset-cli.git
```
